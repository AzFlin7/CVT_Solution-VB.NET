                                                    We are happy to announce our participation in the first ever Technology Day Extrusion and Compounding. This day-long event will take place on June 20, 2018, at the German Plastics Center SKZ in Würzburg, Germany.
                                                    <br /><br />


                                                    The 1st Technology Day Extrusion and Compounding is a unique opportunity for industry representatives to gather and learn more about the development of custom-made materials at SKZ. Through a series of short lectures, the participants will have a chance to find out more about compounding and extrusion as the two manufacturing processes that will take the plastics industry into the future.

                                                    <br /><br />

                                                    Compounding involves melt blending of plastics with specific additives to create brand new, custom-made materials. Extrusion is a continuous production of plastic profiles that vary in shape, size, and other properties.

                                                    <br /><br />

                                                    The German Plastics Center SKZ has a long experience in these two industrial processes. Over the past 15 years, industry experts have had the opportunity to collaborate with SKZ, as well as to carry out research and development at the SKZ Compounding and Extrusion Center that stretches over an area of 1,500 square meters. SKZ also sees this event as an opportunity to showcase its facilities to the industry insiders and discuss the possibility of future collaborations with the plastics industry leaders.

                                                    <br /><br />

                                                    The event will begin at 9:00 with a keynote speech given by SKZ’s Marieluise Lang, followed by three 15-minute introductory lectures on compounding and intelligent extrusion solutions. Starting at 10:00, representatives of some of the country’s top companies in the field will give short lectures on these two technologies and their experience with their implementation.

                                                    <br /><br />

                                                    From 13:15, the participants will have an opportunity to witness live demonstrations of the development and manufacturing process at the SKZ Plastics Center. The event will conclude at 19:00 at the Kulturspeicher Würzburg Museum with a pre-launch meeting for the SKZ Networking Day, which will take place the next day.

                                                    <br /><br />
