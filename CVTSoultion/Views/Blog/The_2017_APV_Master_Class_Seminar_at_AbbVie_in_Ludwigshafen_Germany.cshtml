                                                    We would like to announce our participation in the 2017 APV Master Class Seminar, which will take place on November 7-9, 2017 in Ludwigshafen, Germany.

                                                    <br /> <br />

                                                    Hosted in cooperation with AbbVie, the master class will examine the topic of amorphous solid dispersions (ASD) in relation to systems, stability, and the formulation of ASDs.
                                                    <br /> <br />


                                                    In particular, it aims to tackle the issue of the influx of chemical entities that offer poor water solubility, which has caused formulation issues throughout the pharmaceutical industry. The master class will make a case for the use of ASDs and amorphous systems as replacements for these chemical entities, with a particular focus on how to develop and use such methods appears in pharmaceutical production.
                                                    <br /> <br />


                                                    Over the course of three days, the master class will introduce the concept of ASDs and amorphous systems, including critical evaluations of their viability in the pharmaceutical sector. It will then move onto more practical discussions related to the manufacture, production, and use of these solutions in the current setting.

                                                    <br /> <br />

                                                    The program covers nine broad topics over three days, each of which contains several lectures and keynote speeches.

                                                    Professor Duncan Craig is a Fellow of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society (RPS) and a member of its Expert Advisor Panel and Education Advisory Panel. His research interests include the use of new technologies to create solid drug delivery systems and the use of imaging and thermal methods in the pharmaceutical sector, as well as the development of new delivery systems. He will host a discussion on ASD characterization through the use of analytical methods.
