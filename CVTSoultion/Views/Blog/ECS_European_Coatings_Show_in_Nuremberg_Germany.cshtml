                                                    ColVisTec is happy to announce it will be an exhibitor at the upcoming ECS—European Coatings Show.
                                                    <br /><br />


                                                    Following the record-breaking success of the 2017 edition, the European Coatings Show is set to return in 2019. Taking place at the Nuremberg Exhibition Centre between March 19 and 21, the ECS will once again bring the leaders of the paint and coatings world to one place and provide a tantalizing glimpse of what the future has in store for this industry.

                                                    <br /><br />

                                                    Whether it is paints and coatings, adhesives and sealants, construction chemicals, or the equipment which accompanies these industries, the ECS is the place where it all comes together. And considering how these products face ever-growing demands, the need to stay ahead of the curve grows larger with each passing month.

                                                    <br /><br />

                                                    Therefore, the ECS is the place where the decision makers can come face-to-face with the innovation leaders and find concrete solutions which benefit all parties involved. Emerging trends, latest technologies, and every other element of the production and application of these products – everything has its place under the roof of the Nuremberg Exhibition Centre.
