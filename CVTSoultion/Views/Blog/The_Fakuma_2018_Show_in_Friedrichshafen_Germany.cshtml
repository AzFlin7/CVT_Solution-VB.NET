                                                    Today, ColVisTec would like to invite you to join us at the Friedrichshafen Exhibition Centre for the 26th Fakuma International Trade Fair for Plastics Processing.
                                                    <br /><br />


                                                    Taking place over five days between October 16-20, 2018 the event is expected to attract over 1,800 exhibitors from all over the world, who will present their latest products, technologies, and innovations in the plastics processing sector.

                                                    <br /><br />

                                                    The world’s leading industrial plastics processing exhibition, Fakuma 2018 will focus on new technologies that promise to move the plastics sector forward in the coming years. Furthermore, it will highlight new tools and processes that will make plastic processing more efficient in the coming years. Examples include 3D printing, injection molding, and thermoforming, among others.
                                                    <br /><br />


                                                    The event currently has 24 scheduled talks, though it is likely that this number will increase closer to the start date as there are still slots to fill. Several of these discussions will focus on the subject of metal replacement, covering topics such as the advances made in the industry thus far, and what suppliers need to know to create suitable metal replacements for your project.
                                                    <br /><br />


                                                    Further presentations discuss new products, such as Edgar Düvel and Thilo Stier’s discussion of the Plasma-SealTight® technology, which aids in the bonding of certain metals and plastics.

                                                    <br /><br />

                                                    Several presentations also focus on the implementation of secondary technology in the plastics industry, such as the correct use of software to add value to your projects and create a better experience for your customers.

                                                    <br /><br />

                                                    These technical presentations will predominantly feature exhibitors, who will be available for further discussion and networking opportunities during the event. Each presentation is also free of charge to all who attend, with most lasting between 30 and 45 minutes.
                                                    <br /><br />
