                                                    ResearchFarm® is an industry-wide, cross-disciplinary exhibition that gathers pharmaceutical workers active in all fields of the pharmaceutical development. It includes developers like ColVisTec, as well as members of the academic and regulatory bodies. The event provides a unique platform for them to present their findings and learn about the recent trends, developments, and products in the pharmaceutical field.

                                                    <br /><br />

                                                    The 2018 exhibition is organized as part of the 11th World Meeting on Pharmaceutics, Biopharmaceutics, and Pharmaceutical Technology, also taking place in Granada, Spain. Over the course of four days, this year’s main event will include four working sessions with oral presentations. Two of them will focus on industry-related topics, while the remaining two will consist of short talks about the papers submitted ahead of this year’s event.
                                                    <br /><br />


                                                    This year’s conference will host 12 plenary lectures, covering topics like oral and transmucosal drug delivery, as well as different applications of 3D printing in the pharmaceutical industry. The oral presentations of papers will be organized into several main categories. They will include new manufacturing technologies, nanoparticles, controlled drug delivery, peptide and protein formulation, and printing technologies.

                                                    <br /><br />

                                                    Researchers will also have an opportunity to present their recent findings in the form of posters at the accompanying ResearchFarm® exhibition. This will allow visitors to talk to authors, ask them about their methodology, and have productive exchanges.
                                                    <br /><br />


                                                    During the four-day ResearchFarm® exhibition, ColVisTec will be exhibiting at Booth 51 on the first floor of the Granada Congress Center. You’ll find us in the lower section of the hall, across the way from the main entrance.
