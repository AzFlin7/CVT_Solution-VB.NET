                                                    We are proud to announce that ColVisTec’s Director of Sales, Marketing, and Customization Fuat Eker will be one of the lecturers at the upcoming seminar “Extrusion Technology in Food Processing.” This three-day seminar will be held at the ZDS – Central College of the German Confectionery Industry in Solingen, Germany, from May 28 to 30, 2018.
                                                    <br /> <br />

                                                    The primary objective of the seminar is to provide an extensive theoretical and practical introduction to extrusion processes and techniques. As such, the classes will focus on the possible applications and functionalities of a variety of extruders. The participants will also have an opportunity to see practical demonstrations of these applications.
                                                    <br /> <br />

                                                    Some of the main topics of the “Extrusion Technology in Food Processing” seminar include:
                                                    <br /> <br />


                                                    Extrusion processes, systems, and applications <br />

                                                    Twin-screw extruders, turbo-extruders, and planetary roller extrusion <br />

                                                    Changes in the process parameters and their impact on the final product <br />

                                                    Raw materials intended for use in extruded products <br />

                                                    <br />

                                                    This seminar is aimed at newcomers to the topic, as well as professionals working in production, quality assurance, product development, marketing, sales, and the supply chain industry.

                                                    <br /> <br />
