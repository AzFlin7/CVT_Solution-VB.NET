De Montfort University (DMU) of Leicester will host the annual conference on March 26, 2019 in Leicester, UK. The goal of the Symposium is to explore how the industry can provide better support to national healthcare systems and since our company has strong ties to the pharmaceutical production, ColVisTec will have a presence at this prestigious event.

                                                    <h3>Quality by Design</h3>



                                                    Quality by Design, or QbD, is a methodical approach to designing products that have taken firm roots in the pharmaceutical industry. The goal is to offer safe and effective drugs to patients and constantly improve quality and strive for breakthroughs. De Montfort University is one of the UK’s top institutions for QbD education and a natural fit to host the event.
                                                    <br /><br />


                                                    The Symposium will bring together experts from three crucial fields — industry, academia, and policy making. They will have the opportunity to share their insights concerning the QbD approach and discuss how its real-life implementation is progressing. This will cover both the latest technological and scientific advancements and other questions of interest to the pharmaceutical production.

                                                    <br /><br />

                                                    The speakers (from the DMU and many other institutions/companies) will give presentations on topics such as digital transformation, science, and innovation. There will also be a forum discussing the way this industry operates and the changes that are happening.

                                                    <h3>QbD and ColVisTec</h3>



                                                    By definition, QbD puts emphasis on process control. This is what makes ColVisTec’s technology a perfect fit for it. Our inline UV-Vis, NIR, Raman spectroscopy devices add groundbreaking levels of accuracy to the assembly line and provide real-time measurements. This means our systems thrive in demanding manufacturing environments and provide notable quality gains.

                                                    <br /><br />

                                                    Our spectrophotometry solutions allow manufacturers to truly move their factories into the digital era. During that process, precision and control are of the utmost importance. The values we strive for resonate with the DMU, which is why we are proud to have partnered with this renowned institution.
