                                                    ColVisTec is going to participate in the Pharma Extrusion Academy 2018. This two-day training will take place on October 24 and 25, 2018 at the Ramada Nürnberg Parkhotel and the Leistritz Group headquarters in Nuremberg, Germany.
                                                    <br /><br />


                                                    Aimed at pharmaceutical professionals, this intensive training course will focus on the many possible applications of extrusion technologies in the industry. Despite the fact that pharma extrusion lines are readily available, to operate them while ensuring stability and optimum product quality, companies need a highly skilled and well-trained staff. They have to understand not only how to operate the extruder, but how the process itself works.
                                                    <br /><br />


                                                    The Pharma Extrusion Academy 2018 will gather the leading experts in the field, who will teach both theoretical and practical courses on the use of extrusion lines in the pharmaceutical industry. Some of the main topics include:
                                                    <br /><br />

                                                    The use of Process Analytical Technology (PAT) and Design of Experiments (DoE) for operational excellence
                                                    <br /><br />


                                                    This training is an excellent opportunity for Research & Development staff, as well as lab and production personnel to gain new knowledge and skills. According to the organizers, trainees can expect the following results:
                                                    <br /><br />


                                                    A better understanding of the extrusion technology and process<br />

                                                    Extensive knowledge of various types of extrusion lines used in the pharmaceutical industry<br />

                                                    Expert tips on extrusion lines cleaning and maintenance<br />
                                                    <br /><br />


                                                    The event will also serve as a unique platform to share experiences with experts and get their opinion on the main problems and challenges pharmaceutical industry professionals may encounter while incorporating the extrusion technology.
