                                                    A joint organizational effort between the International Association for Pharmaceutical Technology (APV), the De Montfort University (DMU) of Leicester, and BASF SE (one of the world’s largest chemical producers), the APV Expert Workshop will take place on June 5–6, 2019 in Leicester, UK. We are proud to inform that ColVisTec will be a part of this notable event. Specifically, Andreas Berghaus, our Director of Engineering & Technology, will be actively involved in the program of the workshop.



                                                    <h3>The Workshop</h3>



                                                    Quality by Design, frequently abbreviated to QbD, is a part of the efforts to automate process control for the advanced pharmaceutical production using the concept of continuous manufacturing in an attempt to make real drug products — from powder to tablets.
                                                    <br /><br />


                                                    The DMU has taken great strides to advance the cause of QbD. To that end, it has partnered with numerous organizations and companies (we are proud to be among them). One of the results of those efforts is this Expert Workshop. It will focus on the application of QbD in continuous processing of modern drugs.
                                                    <br /><br />


                                                    Through presentations and practical sessions, this workshop will provide the entrants with valuable experience in three areas:

                                                    <br /><br />

                                                    Making actual pharmaceutical products with the use of QbD
                                                    <br />
                                                    Understanding continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing and the concept behind it
                                                    <br />
                                                    Optimizing the development of new pharmaceutical products



                                                    <h3>Andreas Berghaus</h3>



                                                    Leaders in several industries have recognized ColVisTec’s inline spectroscopy solutions as a valuable PAT tool in enhancing process control. Our inline UV-Vis, NIR, Raman spectroscopy can provide highly accurate readings generated in real-time without requiring recalibration. This boosts productivity and quality of the modern pharmaceutical plant, paving the way to an Industry 4.0 ready production line. As such, our solutions go hand-in-hand with the QbD approach and the concept of continuous manufacturing.
                                                    <br /><br />


                                                    Because of this, Andreas Berghaus will play a prominent role in the workshop. More precisely, he will oversee a segment of it focusing on PAT solutions for the demanding continuous pharmaceutical production. Walkiria Schlindwein (an Associate Professor at DMU) and Thorsten Cech (a manager at BASF SE) will be in charge of the other portions of the seminar.
                                                    <br /><br />


                                                    We are very excited to be among such esteemed experts and look forward to contributing to a memorable event.
                                                    <br /><br />
