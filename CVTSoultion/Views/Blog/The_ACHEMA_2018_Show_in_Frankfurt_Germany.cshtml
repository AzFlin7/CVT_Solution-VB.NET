                                                    We are delighted to announce our upcoming participation in the ACHEMA 2018 Show, which takes place on June 11-15, 2018 in Frankfurt, Germany. The show is the leading forum for discussion in the process and chemical engineering industries, offering a platform for global organizations to showcase their innovations, create new trends, and inform their business decisions.
                                                    <br /><br />


                                                    Over the course of five days, the event will focus on traditional ACHEMA sectors, including storage and packing techniques, and pharmaceuticals. However, the 2018 event will also tackle topics in the material flow, supply chain management, intralogistics, and intermodal transport sectors, among others.
                                                    <br /><br />


                                                    The event hopes to attract those in the logistics, pharmaceutical, and chemical sectors to meet its thousands of exhibitors from all over the world. The 2015 event attracted 3,800 exhibitors, with ACHEMA anticipating a higher number for 2018.

                                                    <br /><br />

                                                    The event will offer information based on three focal topics during its running period. These include Biotech for Chemistry, which will chart the increasing viability of renewable ingredients, and chart the course from gene to product, with a focus on the integration of new biotechnological and chemical techniques.
                                                    <br /><br />
                                                    Flexible Production will examine industry 4.0 as it pertains to production, with a particular focus on modular plants and automation.
                                                    <br /><br />


                                                    Finally, the Chemical and Pharma Logistics focal topic will examine advances in the stocking and transportation of pharmaceuticals and chemicals. The subject covers all aspects of transport, including intermodal transport and intralogistics.

                                                    <br /><br />

                                                    Furthermore, the event will cover some more general topics, including laboratory technology, labor safety, and chemical engineering.
                                                    <br /><br />


                                                    Over 170,000 attendees from more than 100 countries will have the opportunity to meet key decision makers in both the pharmaceutical and chemical sectors, as well as develop their networks. There will also be a heavy media presence at the event, plus exhibitors have the opportunity to host presentations to establish themselves as influencers in their industries.

                                                    <br /><br />
