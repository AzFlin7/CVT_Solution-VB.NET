                                                    In the wake of our successful sponsorship of 2017’s Quality by Design Symposium, ColVisTec is delighted to announce its involvement with the 6th Quality by Design Symposium.
                                                    <br /><br />


                                                    The all-day event takes place at The Venue at De Montfort University, Leicester, and will bring together industry regulators, experts, and academics to discuss the most pertinent issues affecting the sector.
                                                    <br /><br />


                                                    All told, the event is expected to attract approximately 150 delegates, of which around two-thirds are influencers or part of the industry. This offers ample opportunity for networking, plus those in the industry can learn about how to implement the QbD principles in their workplaces.
