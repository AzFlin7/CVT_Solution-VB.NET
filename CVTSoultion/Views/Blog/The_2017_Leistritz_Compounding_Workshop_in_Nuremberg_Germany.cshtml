                                                    ColVisTec is proud to announce its participation in the 2017 Leistritz Compounding Workshop, which takes place at the Sheraton Carlton Hotel in Nuremberg, Germany on November 8-9, 2017.
                                                    <br /><br />


                                                    Attendees will enjoy several presentations held by speakers from all over the world, in addition to several practical demonstrations, which take place at the Leistritz technical center. Each discussion features German and English translations, with each attendee receiving a folder that includes various conference documents upon arrival.
                                                    <br /><br />


                                                    The two-day event also includes food, including an evening meal on November 8, and transfers between the hotel and technical center for demonstrations. However, attendees are asked to arrange their own accommodation, with limited rooms available at the Sheraton Carlton Hotel at a preferential price.
                                                    <br /><br />


                                                    The majority of the speeches will focus on the subject of compounding. They will cover a range of topics, including cable compounds for use in semiconductors and similar applications, inline compounding, recipes for several engineering compounds, and film extrusion.
                                                    <br /><br />


                                                    The event also offers plenty of networking opportunities, with the break and lunch sessions being ideal for speaking to key influencers in the extrusion and compound sectors.
                                                    <br /><br />


                                                    All told, the program includes 12 presentations, some of which split into technical and practical sessions. They include the opening discussion on cable compounds with Dennis Labbe.
                                                    <br /><br />
